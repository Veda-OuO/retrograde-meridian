  <div class="title">Staff Car</div>
  <div class="text-box">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wanting to avoid awkward conversation and prying eyes, I waited for the Staff Car to empty before slipping my way inside.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The furnishings were stark and worn when compared with the rest of the train. Not a single painting hung from the sterile walls. Brown carpet ran the length of the hallway; it reminded me of spilled coffee or dark mud from the bottom of a farmer&rsquo;s boot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I made a quick pass of the small lounge. A long bench ran the length of the windows on the far side, two wooden chairs facing toward it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the wall nearest the entrance, I found a posted schedule tracking when each employee was on duty.</span></p>

<div class="text-box">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making a quick note of the times, I walked deeper into the car.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows lined the wall to my left; to my right a series of three rooms stretched the length of the hall, each belonging to a member of the staff.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first was the cook Gregory&rsquo;s room. It was unlocked, and I let myself inside. The floor was littered with dirty laundry, and the entire space smelled of sweat. I could hardly breathe, so I did my best to make my search quick.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was little of interest in the shallow closet&ndash;his entire wardrobe was lying on the floor, anyways. Under the bed, only the remnants of late night snacks and dirty dishware. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A wobbly nightstand sat next to the bed, its dark blue paint having faded many years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside, I found, amongst a mess of recipes and food stock records, an overhead map of the Passenger Car. It was hand drawn. He had written the names of each guest on their respective rooms.</span></p>

<div class="text-box">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put it in my pocket before stepping back into the hallway.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next room belonged to Thomas. It was similarly austere. But, above the small window, a shelf for books had been hung on the wall. Titles I&rsquo;d never heard of filled the space from one end to the other; another pile of books sat by the bed. Texts on Aztec death rituals. Burial practices of the Maya. Sacrificial rites at Teotihuacan. An encyclopedia of modern Archeology.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sifting through his remaining materials, I found a collection of pay stubs bearing Robert Stanton&rsquo;s signature amongst the dozens of hand-written notes. Each was for 15 dollars&ndash; more than my weekly salary as a police officer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the bottom of the pile, my fingers met with a single key. Scratched by hand into its largest face was the number &ldquo;5&rdquo;. Thinking it might aid me in my investigation, I slipped it into my pocket.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satisfied with my efforts, I proceeded to Adrian&rsquo;s room. It was the largest of the three. The bed was neatly made, and his clothes were organized and hung with care in the closet. A dark wooden nightstand sat beside the bed, but, opening its single drawer, I found nothing but a pack of cigarettes inside. It had been wrapped in a handkerchief and hidden in the very back of the drawer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the first leg of our journey into Mexico, I remember Mr. Stanton stating in clear terms that the train was a smoke-free space&ndash;of course, Robert had lit his first cigar only moments later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, I checked under Adrian&rsquo;s bed, finding nothing of substance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It was when I turned to leave that I saw a maintenance list of each car in the train hung above the door.</span></p>
